Working. Beta. Testing still underway.


<1>  [ pam_capability ]

This is my attempt at building an RBAC or Role-Based Access Control system
for Linux. If you place this in the session requirements for something like
login, this module will set a user's inherited capabilities. By default
the module looks for a configuration file of roles and users in
/etc/security/capability.conf. This can be altered at runtime by setting
the "conf=<filename>" option in the pam configuration file. Please see
the sample configuration file in this distribution.

See the prerequisites section for other legwork you or your administrator
might have to do.


<2>  [ prerequisites ]

You must have libcap installed. If your distribution separates headers
and you are compiling this you might need libcap-devel, libcap2-dev,
or some obviously similar package.

You will also need PAM libraries and headers.  On an Ubuntu 8.10 system
the following packages are needed:

    libcap2-dev
    libpam0g-dev

You must patch your kernel with the patch-capfix-X.Y.Z provided. It should
apply easily, but massaging by hand should be trivial as well.

It is highly recommend to read the latest Linux Capabilities FAQ at:
ftp://ftp.guardian.no/pub/free/linux/capabilities/

<3>  [ compilation and installation ]

-- kernel patch --
1.	cd <linux_src>
2.	patch -p1 < <pam_capability_src>/patch-capfix-X.Y.Z
3.	make [x|menu]config
4.	turn on "Inherit Capabilities Across Exec" in the General
	setup section. NOTE: CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL must be enabled in
	the top-level Code maturity menu.
5.	recompile and reinstall kernel

-- pam_capability.so build --
1.	modify user-modifiable parts of Makefile
2.	make
3.	[sudo] make install

	OR

3.	[sudo] make install-pam
	[sudo] make install-conf
	[sudo] make install-man
	[sudo] make install-doc

4.	edit /etc/security/capability.conf to your taste.
5.	add pam session entries for desired applications (see below)


<3>  [ how to use pam_capability ]

To use this module it is recommended that you add the following to an
/etc/pam.d service file:

session    required     /lib/security/pam_capability.so <options>

This is best added to the "login" and "su" services and any other services
that provide "login"-like services of their own where you might want
capabilities set (e.g., sshd).

Supported options are:
	o "debug"
	   log a few things to syslog
	o "conf=<conffile>"
	   specify the location of the configuration file


<4>  [ todo ]

- minimize security risk of (over-)setting capabilities
- scour kernel for places where capable() MACRO should be called but isn't
- document ways to get around have root filesystem permissions to do
  anything useful (big drawback of /proc/sys interface)
- experiment with various role definitions and daemons to create a
  howto on running them without root but with pam_capability roles


<5>  [ license information ]

basically: GPLv2
