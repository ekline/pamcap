[ 0.22 ] 2002 SEP 08

Added "none" capability keyword. Some documenation updates. New pamcap_pwd_dup
function, and pam/rsh/getpwnam bug work-around.

[ 0.21 ] 2002 AUG 19

Documentation added to sample-capability.conf and the capability.conf man
page noting the addition of "cap_fs_mask" functionality.

[ 0.20 ] 2002 AUG 19

Documentation fix. Fixed recursive role inclusion and prefix/postfix
cap text handling to be cleaner and more correct (only at the last possible
moment now, in pamcap_set). Added internal definition for "cap_fs_mask"
in case folks want to define that. NOTE: this means that I have to maintain
the definition of this, but that shouldn't be too hard as it won't change
much, if at all.

[ 0.19 ] 2002 JUL 03

Added pamcap_vers information to debugging output.

[ 0.18 ] 2002 JUL 02

release because I'm a dork and cvs tagged everything without updating the
Makefile version number or this document.

[ 0.17 ] 2002 JUL 02

fixed appending of "cap_setpcap-eip" instead of prepending. Thanks to Jason
Baietto for pointing this out.

[ 0.16 ] 2002 JUL 02

Small build patch from Dave Wilson for SuSe 7.2. New numbering scheme
(a project this small doesn't need three version levels). Place holder
text in HOWTO for SuSe startup script "ls -l /proc/$$/exe" read failure.

[ 0.0.15 ] 2002 JUL 01

Started HOWTO for collecting distribution-specific problem data and
work-arounds, where available, and also (eventually) details about running
services with pamcap. Added some code cleanup patches from Jens. Makefile
change: make install doesn't install the sample-capability.conf over the
one on your system.

[ 0.0.14-pre1 ] 2002 MAY 20

At the suggestion of Jens Richter we're attempting to remove the need for 
all the "+i"'s, et cetera, from the capability.conf file and instead just
concentrate on iheritable permissions, especially since that's of what the
kernel patch makes use. Also prepending "all-i" instead of "all=" so that
we shouldn't need to use "append=<blah>" in the pam.d/* config files. Also
Jens's suggestion. Trying to solve Jen's problem of ls -l /proc/$$ doesn't
show username but root instead!

[ 0.0.13 ] 2002 APR 08

Attempting some code cleanup in an effort help debug Jason Baietto's telnet
login failure problem. Much strangeness might be afoot? Perhaps a pam
version problem. Bug fix for users whose default group is listed not
being recognized, only listed group members in /etc/group were recognized.

[ 0.0.12 ] 2002 APR 03

Added new brilliant pam_capability.8 man page from Joe Ansell via
Jason Baietto. A few Makefile cleanups.

[ 0.0.11 ] 2002 APR 02

fixes for the idiot you maintains this! up the voltage!

[ 0.0.10 ] 2002 APR 02

better function abstraction for append= and correct 2.4.18 patch.

[ 0.0.9 ] 2002 APR 02

Added "append=" option. Updated README to include recommended append lines
for various applications. Added config work and surrounding ifdef to
patch as per recommendation and supplied patch from Jason Baietto.

[ 0.0.8 ] 2002 MAR 31

Default user '*' no longer required as "internal" defaults are sufficient
for login, su, and friends success. Only specify user '*' if you want
default permission to be non-null. Kernel patch seems to be working better.
Root processes that don't call cap_set_proc have the capabilities cleared
as per the normal mechanism.

[ 0.0.7 ] 2002 MAR 29

Documentation bug (changelog not updated). Must be a maintainer problem.
Who hired this guy anyway?

[ 0.0.6 ] 2002 MAR 29

Added contributed documentation from Joe Ansell. Conf file parsing now
verifies the existance of group names and user name for added security.
Non-existant user and group names are ignored allowing valid declarations
to persist.

[ 0.0.5 ] 2002 MAR 29

Added groups support in the capability.conf file. Revised required kernel
modifications and collected them in "patch-rbac-X.Y.Z".

[ 0.0.4 ] 2002 MAR 28

Documentation updates. Changes to build process. Update to kernel mods
required for proper functionality.

[ 0.0.3 ] 2002 MAR 26

At the recommendation of Aaron Kline role declarations can reference other
role declarations. Also some minimal checking of the capability.conf for
security.

[ 0.0.2 ] 2002 MAR 22

Clean up for release on freshmeat. Some documentation, some code cleanup.

[ 0.0.1 ] 2002 MAR 21

Initial working release.
